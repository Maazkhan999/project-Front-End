                A link Crawler is a tool or software that is used to extract hyperlinks from a web page.
                 It can be used to collect links from a single web page or from multiple web pages. 
                 Link grabbers are often used by web scrapers, but they can also be used by individuals 
                 to collect links for personal use, such as for research or for creating a personal link library.
                Link grabbers work by parsing the HTML code of a web page and extracting 
                all of the hyperlinks. The links can be extracted in different ways, 
                such as by using CSS selectors, XPath queries, or regular expressions.
                 Once the links have been extracted, they can be saved to a file or to a database.</p>
